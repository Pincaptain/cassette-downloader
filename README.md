# cassette-downloader
An android application that allows the user to browse, convert to mp3 and download any desired video.

The application was written in android studio using the google developers youtube api, https://www.yt2mp3.ws/developers/ convert and download api served in a webview and http://square.github.io/picasso/ to load the thumbnails from the destination url.

Full disclaimer I have only recently began working in android studio and this was my first project.
